# Student-Record-Management-System-Project

A complete academic project for managing student records digitally. This repository contains:

* **Source code** for record management operations
* **Technical report** describing system design and implementation
* **Presentation (PPT)** for project explanation and demonstration

## Overview

The Student Record Management System is designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve student information. It replaces manual record keeping with a structured digital solution.

The system supports:

* Adding new student records
* Updating existing student information
* Deleting student data
* Searching and filtering records
* Displaying complete student lists

## Key Features

* Secure and structured data handling
* User-friendly interface (CLI or GUI based on implementation)
* Fast search and retrieval
* Modular and maintainable code design
* Well-documented report and presentation
